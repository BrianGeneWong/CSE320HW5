How to run:
"make clean all" will delete both main and mem executables and remake them.
You can also use "make main" or "make mem" seperately.
Use ./main and ./mem to run each program, and please do so in seperate terminals.

I decided to go with a segmented memory approach. each process can only use up to 256 bytes.
The first process will get range 0-255, in mem.c, 2nd process will get 256-511, and so on.
